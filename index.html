            <h2 id="about"> About </h2>
                <p>
                 While my professional experience is still growing, my academic background and practical 
                coursework have provided me with a solid understanding of electrical engineering principles and 
                their applications. During my studies at the University of Nevada, I successfully 
                completed projects involving the design and analysis of electrical circuits, troubleshooting 
                system failures, and collaborating with team members to solve complex problems. These 
                experiences have sharpened my technical skills, critical thinking, and attention to detail.
                I am currently studying coding at Code the Dream, an institution that is helping me advance in my career by offering free coding classes. 
                I am truly grateful for their efforts and ongoing support. My passion for coding continues
                to grow as I learn new skills and challenges, and I am excited about the opportunities ahead in this dynamic field.
